## Microservices Architecture for Movie and Cast Services (Under Development)

...

### Overview

The project follows a microservices architecture, allowing for the independent development, deployment, and scaling of the `movie_service` and `cast_service`. These services interact with separate databases for movies and casts, providing a modular and maintainable structure.

### Services

### Getting Started

...

#### Running the Services

1. Start the services using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will launch the `movie_service`, `cast_service`, PostgreSQL databases, and an Nginx server for routing.

2. Access the services:

   - Movie Service: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/movies](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/movies)
   - Cast Service: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/casts](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/casts)
